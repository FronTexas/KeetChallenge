# Challenge-Frontend
This is a technical challenge for frontend engineer candidates for KeetHealth. This challenge is designed to assess your skills as a frontend engineer.

# The Challenge
Build a to-do app using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) that consumes [this public todo GraphQL API](https://todo-mongo-graphql-server.herokuapp.com/graphql) using only the packages listed in the package.json file. The finished web app should implement every query and mutation available on the API.

# Getting Started
1. Fork this repo.
2. Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
3. Run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```
4. You should see Compiled Successfully on terminal and the base app appear in your browser.
5. Build your webapp using the components available in the UI kit [react-md](https://react-md.mlaursen.com/). While you are free to build your own components, please utilize the kit wherever possible.
