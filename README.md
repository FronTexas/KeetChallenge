# Challenge-Frontend
This is a technical challenge for frontend engineer candidates for KeetHealth. This challenge is designed to assess your skills as a frontend engineer.

# The Challenge
Build a to-do app using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) that consumes [this API](https://github.com/NoowPTdev/graphql-todo) using only the packages listed in the package.json file. The finished web app should implement the following queries/mutations:
- todos
- add
- toggle
- destroy
- save

Keep in mind that the API database is public and shared, thus you may see data changes caused by other users.

# Getting Started
1. Fork this repo.
2. Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
3. Run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```
4. You should see Compiled Successfully on terminal and the base app appear in your browser.
5. Head to [the API repo](https://github.com/NoowPTdev/graphql-todo), fork the repo, and follow the instructions on the README.
6. Once the server is running, begin building your web app using the components available in the UI kit [react-md](https://react-md.mlaursen.com/). While you are free to build your own components, please utilize the kit wherever possible.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you run into any issues setting up this boilerplate, please refer to [the user guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). If you are unable to find a solution, please contact Ardy from KeetHealth.

# Grading

- Utilization of ES6 & ES7 features
- Code Readability
- Using Component, PureComponent, and Stateless components
